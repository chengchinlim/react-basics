API server -> render server -> browser

SSR (Render server) -> generate HTML from server

index.js -> webpack -> babel -> bundle.js (run on node server)
node server cannot read jsx by default!!!

jsx -> server js code (webpack)
react components -> html (renderToString from react-dom-server)

bundle.js has to be regenerated if any react components change

1. send webpage html
2. send bundle.js (for client side)
3. (same as CSR react app, render 2nd time)

browser req -> express route handler -> react router

BrowserRouter -> ONLY client! (can see path on address bar)
StaticRouter -> SSR (required prop -> context)
